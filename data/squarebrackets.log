added *.wfasl to .cvsignores
----------------------------
revision 1.1
date: 2002/02/24 17:35:11;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;
added .cvsignore to all src dirs - it seems to be an artifact of the
cygwin cvs client that .cvsignore works in subdirs.

revision 1.8

revision 1.22
date: 2003/01/08 22:04:06;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -3

the emacs rep.

This is still pretty broken.

Weld 0.6
----------------------------
revision 1.20
date: 2002/08/12 09:40:45;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -5
Changes to various LOOPs to use a more idiosyncratic thing:
    (loop for (i . j) in x
      ...)

rather than

    (loop for y in x
          for (i . j) = y
          ...)

I don't know why I ever did the latter - I must have misunderstood
destructuring in LOOP.
----------------------------
revision 1.19
date: 2002/08/08 21:04:57;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +91 -59
Make the various boot-location control things variables, and allow
`fileless' booting if they are NIL.  This helps being a library
as you can control where it boots better.
----------------------------
revision 1.18
date: 2002/07/31 11:36:38;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -3
Fixed a problem which made it fail to boot (hosts-equal was getting :WILD)
Added a couple of switches to enable backtracing during boot and
to enable backtracing in the rep.

revision 1.17

revision 1.14

ENSURE-WELD-BOOT-STATE
----------------------------
revision 1.13
date: 2002/07/04 01:06:11;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +25 -2
Added DEBUG-PARAMETERS boot form, and corresponding hook.
Made the rep understand :backtrace t to mean `backtrace on error'
----------------------------
revision 1.12
date: 2002/06/09 23:37:59;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +16 -1
New function, PROBE-WELD-BOOT-FILE, which lets us know if a boot file
can be found.  This lets it tell if non-interactive booting is OK.
----------------------------
revision 1.11
date: 2002/06/08 23:45:11;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +13 -18
Fairly large changes to the module structure: weld is now the substrate
code (weld-low), together with session, application & rep code.  CRS and NBS
can be loaded on top of this, and should be distributed as separate
systems.

Modules can now load patches for themselves, based on a patch tree
corresponding to the module tree.

merge to MAIN from EXPERIMENTAL-NBS.

revision 1.9
date: 2002/05/02 11:34:14;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +18 -11
branches:  1.9.2;
Added an option to ENSURE-WELD-BOOT-STATE and its callees to allow
specification of the file to boot from.  So

	(ensure-weld-boot-state :host :boot-file "/local/.../boot.def")

will boot it to HOST from a given file.

I'm not sure this is enough, since other things can cause it to boot,  As
a way of getting around this there is also a NO-USER option, which says
just to fake a user boot (don't actually read the weldrc).  So you can say

	(ensure-weld-boot-state :user :boot-file ... :no-user t)

which will not read the user's weldrc, but will look like it has.

changes to new hook definition format (with arglist).
----------------------------
revision 1.2
date: 2002/02/23 02:37:12;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +7 -3
added new feature: COM.CLEY.WELD/NGDM which means `this version of weld
is eing compiled as NGDM'.  Conditionalised the boot location and rc file
names based on this feature.

initial import of WELD (ex NGDM)
----------------------------
revision 1.7.2.1
date: 2002/03/13 11:25:39;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +7 -2
Changed all the DECLARE-MODULE forms to find the write date of the
source file if possible, so that module information is a bit more informative
and stable.  Maybe they should do this by default?
----------------------------
revision 1.9.2.1
date: 2002/05/15 15:23:35;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
Pervasive changes to module declarations - Anders pointed out they
were buggy because they tried to ask for *compile-file-pathname* when
it didn't exist.

Made sure import directory exists before an import

allowed :CONCRETE as well as :LEAF, and fixed a bug in featurized classes

revision 1.11
date: 2002/08/16 21:10:04;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2
Changes to allow variant cf read packages.  This changes the syntax

revision 1.10
date: 2002/10/18 00:21:41;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -2
General checkin of some improvements to the module tree drawing stuff.
This still needs some error handling for menus at the weld level, the
module chaining stuff from NBS.  Then it is probably OK as a demo
of NGDM 1.2 (and the weld version should probably be bumped then too)

revision 1.9

Make the various boot-location control things variables, and allow
`fileless' booting if they are NIL.  This helps being a library
as you can control where it boots better.

Change all package definitions to use ORG.TFEB.CLC rather than CL.  This means
that all packages now get the conduits version of DEFPACKAGE, and will
not be compatible with anything earlier.  The tag LAST-OLD-PACKAGE-NAMES is
the last NGDM-1.0 compatible version.

revision 1.1.2.1
date: 2002/05/05 21:57:47;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;  lines: +44 -0
Reworked system declarations: split them amongst the subsystems, and
made the top-level sysdcl simply load all the subsys decls.

Moved package definitions into per-system files.  Packages still use
non-structured names though this is a step towards making them structured.

----------------------------
revision 1.1
date: 2002/06/08 23:45:11;  author: tfb;  state: Exp;
Fairly large changes to the module structure: weld is now the substrate
code (weld-low), together with session, application & rep code.  CRS and NBS
can be loaded on top of this, and should be distributed as separate
systems.

Modules can now load patches for themselves, based on a patch tree
corresponding to the module tree.
